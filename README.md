I proposes two improved YOLOv8-based models, YOLOv8-StarNet-CGA and SCS-YOLOv8, for detecting pine wilt disease-infected trees, under-construction farmhouses, and forest fires. 
In YOLOv8-StarNet-CGA, the StarNet module and Content-Guided Attention (CGA) are integrated into the backbone to enhance global feature extraction and focus on critical regions through dynamic weight adjustment. 
In SCS-YOLOv8, the original CIoU loss is also replaced with SIoU loss to optimize shape and orientation consistency, improving robustness. Experiments on UAV datasets covering diverse national park scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the models.
